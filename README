# queuefs #

queuefs is a FUSE filesystem that acts as a work queue.
It executes a command on all files written to it.
More precisely:

  * When a file is written and closed, the command is executed on it
    in a concurrent child process.
  * The command may be successful (return status 0) or unsuccessful.
  * If the command was successful then the file is left as-is, moved to a
    success directory or deleted.
  * If the command was unsuccessful then the command is retried after
    a delay of that defaults to 30 seconds. After n tries, the file may
    be moved to a fail directory.

Files are stored in the directory queuefs is mounted on.

## Installation ##

Dependencies:

	* fuse 2.8.0 or above (http://fuse.sf.net/).
	* glib 2.26.0 or above.

Compile and install as usual:

If you want the mounts made by non-root users to be visible to other users,
